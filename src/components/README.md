# Components Plan

- `GalleryList`: hosts the Raycast List/Gallery view with search bar filters and the action panel.
- `FilterForm`: the `Action.Push` filter sheet, covering directory, tags, channel, recursion inputs, etc.
- `UploadForm`: used by the standard upload command with fields prefilled via preferences.
- `ClipboardUploadPreview`: displays parsed clipboard results (files, image links) for confirmation before upload.
- `FileDetailPanel`: shows the large preview and metadata (size, channel, timestamp, etc.).
